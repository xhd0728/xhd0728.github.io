I am currently pursuing an M.S. degree in Computer Science at [Northeastern University](https://neu.edu.cn/), focusing on Information Retrieval and Large Language Models.

My research interests span Information Retrieval, Multimodality, Multi-Agent Systems, and Recommendation Systems. Currently, my work involves RAG-SFT-DPO data generation, instruction tuning for Large Language Models, and designing recommendation systems leveraging these models.

I hold a B.S. degree in Computer Science from Harbin Engineering University, where I was supervised by Assistant Researcher [Chao Li](https://mohub.net/help/MoHub/UserServiceCases/Cases1.html#%E6%95%99%E5%B8%88%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D). I am also engaged in research internships at [NEUIR](https://neuir.github.io/) under the guidance of Associate Professor [Zhenghao Liu](https://edwardzh.github.io/) (from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn)), as well as at [Qiyuan Lab](https://qiyuanzp.zhiye.com/) and [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), supervised by [Yukun Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=B88nSvIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) (from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn)) and [Chenyan Xiong](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cx/) (from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu)).
