I am currently pursuing a M.S. degree in computer science at [Northeastern University](https://neu.edu.cn/), with a research forcus on Information Retrieval and Large Language Model (LLM).

My research interests include Information Retrieval, Multimodality, SFT, RAG and Multi agent. I am currently working on research releated to RAG-SFT Data Generation and Instruction Tuning for Large Language Model (LLM).

I graduated from [Harbin Engineering University](http://www.hrbeu.edu.cn/) with a B.S. degree in [Computer Science and Technology](http://cstc.hrbeu.edu.cn/), supervised by Associate Professor [Chao Li](https://mohub.net/help/MoHub/UserServiceCases/Cases1.html#%E6%95%99%E5%B8%88%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D). Currently, I am doing a research internship at [NEUIR](https://neuir.github.io/) in  [Northeastern University](https://neu.edu.cn/), supervised by Associate Professor [Zhenghao Liu](https://edwardzh.github.io/) <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4vrZRk0AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url_1 | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> . In addition, I am also working at [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), supervised by [Yukun Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=B88nSvIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B88nSvIAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url_2 | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> .

We have established close academic cooperation and exchanges with research institutions such as [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Language Resources](https://yuyanziyuan.blcu.edu.cn/), [OpenBMB](https://modelbest.cn/), [Inspir.ai](https://www.inspirai.com/), [Alibaba](https://ali-home.alibaba.com/), etc. We welcome cooperation and exchanges!
