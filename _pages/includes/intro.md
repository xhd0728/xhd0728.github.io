I am currently pursuing an M.S. degree in Computer Science at [Northeastern University](https://neu.edu.cn/), focusing on Information Retrieval and Large Language Models.

My research interests span NLP, Information Retrieval, LLM, RAG, Recsys, and Multi Modal. Currently, my work involves multi-agent systems, optimization of retrieval augmented generation systems, and instruction tuning for large language models. I have published several papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8VCnj3sAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.

I hold a B.S. degree in Computer Science from Harbin Engineering University, where I was supervised by Assistant Researcher [Chao Li](https://mohub.net/help/MoHub/UserServiceCases/Cases1.html#%E6%95%99%E5%B8%88%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D). I am also engaged in research internships at [NEUIR Lab](https://neuir.github.io/) under the guidance of Associate Professor [Zhenghao Liu](https://edwardzh.github.io/), as well as at [Qiyuan Lab](https://qiyuanzp.zhiye.com/), [OpenBMB](https://www.openbmb.cn/), and [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), supervised by [Yukun Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=B88nSvIAAAAJ).
