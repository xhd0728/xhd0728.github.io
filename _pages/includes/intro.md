I am a senior undergraduate student from the [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://cstc.hrbeu.edu.cn/) of [Harbin Engineering University](http://www.hrbeu.edu.cn/). Currently, I am doing a research internship at [NEUIR](https://neuir.github.io/). I will be pursuing a graduate degree at [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.neu.edu.cn/) of [Northeastern University](https://neu.edu.cn/) in the fall of 2024, and I am fortunate enough to be advised by Associate Professor [Zhenghao Liu](https://edwardzh.github.io/) <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4vrZRk0AAAAJ&hl=en'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fxhd0728%2Fxhd0728.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

We have established close academic cooperation and exchanges with research institutions such as [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Language Resources](https://yuyanziyuan.blcu.edu.cn/), [OpenBMB](https://modelbest.cn/), [Inspir.ai](https://www.inspirai.com/), [Alibaba](https://ali-home.alibaba.com/), etc. We welcome cooperation and exchanges!

My research interests include Information Retrieval, Multi Modal, LLM Pretraining and Multi Agent. I am very interested in Large Language Models, and I believe they will change the world one day.
