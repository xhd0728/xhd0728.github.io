I am currently pursuing an M.S. degree in Computer Science at [Northeastern University](https://neu.edu.cn/), focusing on Information Retrieval and Large Language Models.

My research interests span NLP, Information Retrieval, LLM, RAG, Recsys, and Multi Modal. Currently, my work involves multi-agent systems, optimization of retrieval augmented generation systems, and instruction tuning for large language models.

I hold a B.S. degree in Computer Science from Harbin Engineering University, where I was supervised by Assistant Researcher [Chao Li](https://mohub.net/help/MoHub/UserServiceCases/Cases1.html#%E6%95%99%E5%B8%88%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D). I am also engaged in research internships at [NEUIR Lab](https://neuir.github.io/) under the guidance of Associate Professor [Zhenghao Liu](https://edwardzh.github.io/) (from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn)), as well as at [Qiyuan Lab](https://qiyuanzp.zhiye.com/) and [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), supervised by [Yukun Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=B88nSvIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) (from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn)) and Associate Professor [Chenyan Xiong](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cx/) (from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)).
