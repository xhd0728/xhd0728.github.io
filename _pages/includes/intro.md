I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at [Northeastern University](https://neu.edu.cn/), where my research focuses on Information Retrieval and Large Language Models (LLMs).

My primary research interests include Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Recommender Systems, and Multi-agent Systems. Currently, I am working on optimizing RAG systems and applying reinforcement learning techniques to LLMs. I have published several papers at leading international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8VCnj3sAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.

I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from [Harbin Engineering University](http://www.hrbeu.edu.cn/), where I was mentored by Assistant Researcher [Chao Li](https://mohub.net/help/MoHub/UserServiceCases/Cases1.html#%E6%95%99%E5%B8%88%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D). Additionally, I am currently involved in research internships at [NEUIR Lab](https://neuir.github.io/) under the guidance of Associate Professor [Zhenghao Liu](https://edwardzh.github.io/), as well as at [Qiyuan Lab](https://qiyuanzp.zhiye.com/), [ModelBest](https://modelbest.cn/), and [TsinghuaNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), supervised by [Yukun Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=B88nSvIAAAAJ).
